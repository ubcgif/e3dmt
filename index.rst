Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

Many advancements have been made since the creation of the original tensor code (`MTZ3D <mtz3d.readthedocs.io>__ ). Hightlights include:

    - the ability define electric and magnetic field receivers along arbitrary orientations
    - joint inversion of magnetotelluric and Z-axis tipper data
    - implimentation of improved direct solvers and paralellization
    - the ability to store factorization in RAM or disk
