    True model, magnetotelluric data and the recovered model.


Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

Many advancements have been made since the creation of the original tensor code (`MTZ3D <mtz3d.readthedocs.io>`_ ). Hightlights include:

  - the ability to model both magnetotelluric impedance data and Z-axis tipper data on an OcTree mesh
  - joint inversion of magnetotelluric and Z-axis tipper data
  - the ability to solve linear systems with iterative or direct solvers
