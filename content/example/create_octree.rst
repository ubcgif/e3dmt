Create OcTree Mesh
==================

Version 1 (2014 and 2015)
-------------------------

Here, the code **MTcreate_octree_mesh_e3d.exe** and the input file **MTcreate_mesh.inp** (:ref:`see format <e3dmt_input_octree>`) are used to create an OcTree mesh based on the set of observation location and surface topography. Files relevant to this part of the example are in the sub-folder *octree_mesh*. Before running this example, you may want to do the following:

	- `Download and open the zip folder containing the entire E3DMT version 1 example <https://github.com/ubcgif/e3dmt/raw/master/assets/e3dmt_ver1_example.zip>`__ (if not done already)
	- :ref:`Learn how to run code from command line <e3dmt_octree>`
	- :ref:`Learn the format of the input file <e3dmt_input_octree>`

To generate the OcTree mesh, the following input file was used:

.. figure:: ../inputfiles/images/create_octree_input.png
     :align: center
     :width: 700


The resulting OcTree mesh and surface topography are shown below:

.. figure:: images/octree_mesh1.png
     :align: center
     :width: 500
