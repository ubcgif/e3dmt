Examples
========

Here, the program libraries for E3DMT version 2 will be used to:

    - create an Octree mesh based on the survey
    - create octree models
    - predict MT data for a synthetic model (similar approach for ZTEM)
    - invert MT data created using our synthetic model (similar approach for ZTEM)

Zip folders containing all necessary files can be downloaded here:

    - Files for example using E3DMT version 2 are `downloaded here <https://github.com/ubcgif/e3dmt/raw/manual_ver2/assets/e3dmt_ver2_example.zip>`__
