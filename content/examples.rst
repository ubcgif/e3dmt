Examples
========

Here, the program libraries for E3DMT version 1 will be used to:

  - create an Octree mesh based on the survey
  - create octree models
  - predict MT or ZTEM data for a synthetic model
  - invert MT or ZTEM data created using our synthetic model


Magnetotellurics
----------------

Zip folders containing all necessary files for the magnetotelluric example can be downloaded here:

    - `Files for example <https://github.com/ubcgif/e3dmt/raw/e3dmt/assets/e3dmt_v1_example_MT.zip>`__

The full example is parsed into 4 sections:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    Create octree mesh <exampleMT/create_octree>
    Create octree model <exampleMT/create_model>
    Forward modeling <exampleMT/fwd>
    Inversion <exampleMT/inv>


ZTEM
----

Zip folders containing all necessary files for the ZTEM example can be downloaded here:

    - `Files for example <https://github.com/ubcgif/e3dmt/raw/e3dmt/assets/e3dmt_v1_example_ZTEM.zip>`__

The full example is parsed into 4 sections:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    Create octree mesh <exampleZTEM/create_octree>
    Create octree model <exampleZTEM/create_model>
    Forward modeling <exampleZTEM/fwd>
    Inversion <exampleZTEM/inv>
