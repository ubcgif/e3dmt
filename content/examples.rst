Examples
========

Here, the program libraries for E3DMT version 1 and 2 will be used to:

	- create an Octree mesh based on the survey
	- create octree models
	- predict MT data for a synthetic model (similar approach for ZTEM)
	- invert MT data created using our synthetic model (similar approach for ZTEM)

Zip folders containing all necessary files can be downloaded here:

	- `Files for example using E3DMT version 1 <https://github.com/ubcgif/e3dmt/raw/master/assets/e3dmt_ver1_example.zip>`__
	- Files for example using E3DMT version 1 (*download pending*)
